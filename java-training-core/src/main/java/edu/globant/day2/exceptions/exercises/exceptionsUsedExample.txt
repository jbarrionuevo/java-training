I used Exceptions at many projects in other work, "Business" Exceptions generally.
For example, in a program that processed excel files, if the number of rows of this was superior to a number they configurate it
throws an "TooLargeException".

I used edge cases too.
For example, to manage files i used IOException.

On a project, I used the Guava library and drove Guava's Exceptions. 
The Same with Hibernate
