With Hibernate, which is an ORM, its much easier to retrieve and save the objects, since
we don't need to set and get each field as we need to do with JDBC. The resulting code its 
smaller and easier to understand. Knowing the underlying db we are working with, which has RDBMS tables,
we will obviously choose to work with Hibernate, so not to write all mappings manually.
