(**1,2,3,4 refer to previousy_used.txt, read it first!**)
I plan to have the same layer architecture for the recently created app; for the moment being, we'll have layers 2,3 and 4, and 1 is going to be represented with
a DTOs layer (since client will send DTOs), which will include Hibernate validators (to make some rules mandatory, such as the name of the design cannot be empty,
etc., which will let to provide a feedback to the client, and, if this validators succeed, provide correct objects to the underlying layer).
In this way, I will be able to generate unit tests (testing for example a controller, mocking the services layer; or a
service, mocking the corresponding daos), and integration tests (testing the functionality of the entire app, testing all the layers simoultaneously).

Respecting to tiers, we'll have a 2-tier app, as we will generate only one .jar file (which will represent both the presentation and logic tier), and we'll 
persist and retrieve data from an underlying database, which will represent the data tier.
