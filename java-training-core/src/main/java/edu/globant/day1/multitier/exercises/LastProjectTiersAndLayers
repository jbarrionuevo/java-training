In my last project we have several layers and Tiers
We interact with Service layer that implements a lot of interfaces to access the classes, we have a dao, model, service and webservice layers,
in webservice layer we have the RestApi endpoints, which UI use to send the request. This request is processed in the service layer and formatted in 
order to get data from the backend or another service, requesting this in the DAO layer. We also have a Jobs layer that make some extra work like 
update cache for example.   

Tiers: we have backend (black box), the RestApi and the UI tiers.
