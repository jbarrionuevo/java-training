In ION app I think i will use HashMap for inventory to have every case with his amount, Set for CaseSellers, 
because every sale is different from another so canÂ´t be repeated, same case for Provider and for Costumer,
we need to know what cases bought so I'll use ArrayList, because items can be repeated.
