In my last project we have an exception mapper builder, we have constants
for almost all error types and exceptions,so we create an error with the 
type and code then we can set a cause and a message for this and finally 
build it. This basically was made in order to improve the error log system.
We need to log the exception in order to know where was the error easier. 
In another hand i used some common exception like incorrect or null parameters,
and i remember the last one I use was in case a toggle didnÂ´t exists throws and exception.
