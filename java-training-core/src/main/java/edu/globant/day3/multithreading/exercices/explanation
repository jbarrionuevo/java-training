There's a priority blocking queue, where customers will be put.
Customers may want to deposit, borrow money, or check their accounts.
A customer has priority over another customer if he's trying to deposit money (bank policy). 
If 2 customers are trying to deposit or none of them is, the one with the minor number has priority (since he got first to the queue).
There will be 5 threads at most; a mandatory one, called "enqueuer", which will generate new customers all the time; and then, from 1 to 4 more threads 
(this number is randomly decided at runtime), simulating each one a different bank teller.
The execution of the program always last 20 seconds, after when a queue with the customers which were not attended is shown, saying that they have priority
for the next day since they have already got their numbers. 
During the execution, tellers take the next customer from the queue, and attend him/her.
Depending on the action the customer want to develop, this attention last differently.
