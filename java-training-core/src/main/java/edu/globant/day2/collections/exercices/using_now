In the ION app, I think we'll have to use:
- A Set of Sales in the CaseSeller ('cause they have to keep track of them, but only need them once, not repeated)
- Another Set, in this case of observers, in the Inventory, to keep its observers (providers)
- The inventory may keep a HashMap, associating every Case type with its stock number
- Providers orders may be kept in a Queue, so they are ordered by ascending date (to first attend the oldest ones)
- If customers are going to keep the products they have bought, these could be stored in an ArrayList (cause they 
could be repeated (same product, bought more than once))
