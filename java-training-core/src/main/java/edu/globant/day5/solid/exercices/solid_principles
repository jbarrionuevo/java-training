1) Single Responsibility Principle:
This principle may be applied in most of the aplications, since developers tend to group lots of functionalities together, not respecting this principle
nor the "low coupling" one. We could apply it in validations, where we validate an email for example, validating it's not null, it has an email format, etc;
what we could do is to decouple that function to a Email class, which would have a method such as validateEmail(String email).
2)Open/Close principle
