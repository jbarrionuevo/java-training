I have used hibernate in the past every time I needed to access a database. 
Is the only ORM I have ever used in Java, and my experience was always successful.
Maybe there where sometimes where the errors were not so easy to understand, therefore taking me to create
new annotations or relations that were not necessary.
Its a big advantage that migrating from one SQL db to a NoSQL one does not take many changes in your hibernate 
configuration.
