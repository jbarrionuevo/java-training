In the ION app, I would use:
- SQLExceptions, whenever accessing the db. An example is provided in exercices.daos.SaleDao
- IllegalArgumentException, for example when trying to retrieve a sale without providing a saleId
- I'll create custom exceptions, such as SaleNotFoundException (available in exercices.exceptions.SaleNotFoundException), thrown when trying to
	retrieve a non-existent sale. This exception will be used to catch the error in SaleService, for example, as you can see in exercices.services.SaleSerive.
