Right now I have three layer in my app 
Model that is used to model the objects, a Service Layer that makes the logic of the application taking data from the database using the DAO layer 
to interact with it.

We will have a 2-tier app, we will generate one .jar or .war file containing application tier, and the second is the database tier 
where we are going to persist the data.
