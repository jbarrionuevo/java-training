	 * EXCERCISE 1

	 * On an application where I had to move data from users from a low layer
	 * (the DataAccessLayer) to higher service layer. Because I didn't want anyone
	 * to accidentally change the data on them I used a DTO as a modelObject (TweetDTO)
	 * so I only defined a constructor and the getters on it to move data safely across 
	 * the layers of my application
