As I mentioned before, I have worked in the Social Prevision Institute. There, we have an ubiquitous language; for example, we named "Recovery Plan" to a group
of debts joined together, and we named "Recovery Way" to the way these joined debts would be paid/recovered, whereas, in the english language, its usual to 
associate "Recovery Plan" with a number of fees, or the type of payment; in our project, this was associated with "Recovery Way".
