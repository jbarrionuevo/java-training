Create a db called ion_solid in MySQL. Then, uncomment the code in Application.java which is specified so
it will create the tables the first time you run the app; for further runnings, comment again that code.

You can enter the app with one of these users:
- user: super pass:super  The super admin. Can check the stock of the products and providers stadistics.
- user: seller pass:seller   A store seller. Can register sales, check their receipts, and change sales status
- user: logistic pass: logistic   A logistic team member. Can make orders to the providers, and checks the generated alarms due to low stock of products.

To generate alerts to the logistic team when some case stock is to low, I've implemented the component AlarmThread,
which has a scheduled task called 'checkAlarms', which checks for each casewrapper if its current stock is lower than
its minimum; if true, it generates an alarm containing the product id, and the quantity needed (I've set this quantity 
as the stock needed for recovering the minimum plus 100). This task is executed once a minute, but this delay can be
configured as you like.
