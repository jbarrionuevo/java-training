In my last project, I have used functional programming only a little, just to try it out and get used to its new syntax, replacing for example
the usual java foreach (for ObjectType o: collection) for the functional one (.forEach()), and using the map and filter functions; but, as I said,
it was just a matter of writting less than really taking advantage of its new features.
Now that we have learn a bit more about it, I'll try to use it more often, since it seems to clarify our code a lot.
