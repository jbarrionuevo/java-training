I joined recently to Globant and had not assignment to project.
I applied the DDD technique always without realizing it in college projects and other works.

At ION Solid application:
Case -> represents the main product sold by the company
Customer -> It represents people who buy the Case.
Employee -> It represents the people working in the company. They can be: Seller or Logistic.
Seller -> people who sells Cases to Customer.
Provider -> companies that supply us Cases to sell.
Sale -> It represents the output of Cases in exchange for money. It is performed by Employee
