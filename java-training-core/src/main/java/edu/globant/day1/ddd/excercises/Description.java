	/*EXCERCISE 1
	 * 
	 * On a project related to recover data from Twitter I used classes like
	 * Tweet, User, Hashtag or TweetDAO in order to match my applications names
	 * to the names normally associated to the Twitter network.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * EXCERCISE 2
	 * 
	 * On the excercises.model package you can see how the DDD is applied to the ION Solid
	 * Project. You could see that the Delivery of cases for the warehouse is on
	 * the Delivery class, that the date of the deliver of the product is with
	 * the deliverDate identifier for example and that the products that are in
	 * a Deliver are of type Case which has two subclasses of type OMCase and RealCase
	 * 
	 * Other example would be the Employee hierarchy on which you have two subclasses
	 * one for the LogisticEmployee and the other for the SaleEmployee
	 * 
	 * The excercises.services package contains 3 classes (InventoryManager, LogisticManager
	 * SaleManager) which have the responsabilitie of control the Inventory, the sales and
	 * delivery process.
