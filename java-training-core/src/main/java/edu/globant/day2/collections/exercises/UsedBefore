In my last project we use collections in order to model complex objects, so we had big structures where we have an ArrayList 
of HashMaps and every map has another Arraylist inside with another Map. This structure was already defined and we used to map it
to a Json object. In specials cases we need to order the data for some criteria so we use SortedMap.
