We have already said the differences between hibernate and jdbc. 
Hibernate is the most predominant framework which influenced the Java community to release JPA.
Hibernate gives much more features, where standard JPA implementation doesn't. But using them
combined is for me the best solution.
Hibernate is more likely to change since it is maintained by JBoss (a third party library),
but JPA is not, since it is maintained by the java community. 
Jpa is just a specification, kind of a guide, an API, whereas hibernate is an implementation.
If it implements the JPA api, it will be accepted for its standards.
