	/*
	 * On a project related to recover data from Twitter I used classes like
	 * Tweet, User, Hashtag or TweetDAO in order to match my applications names
	 * to the names normally associated to the Twitter network.
	 * 
	 * On the same application I had to move data from users from a low layer
	 * (the DataAccessLayer) to higher service layer because I didn't want anyone
	 * to accidentally change the data on them I used a DTO as a modelObject so
	 * I only defined a constructor and the getters on it so that I could move
	 * data safely across the layers of my application
	 *
