In order to use dependency injection with Spring, I used Spring Boot. The DI is visible in the layer of services, in which each service (annotated with @Service) 
has an autowired dao object, which be injected in runtime.
DAOs are implemented as interfaces which extend from JpaRepository, which allow us to use methods as findAll, save, etc., without having to implement them.
We can also see a method anotated with @Transactional in OrderService, "addOrders", which will save all the given orders in the underlying database.
