I only used hibernate when i was doing the java bootcamp, as my last projectÂ´s backend was like a black box i didn`t used it there.
I think the benefits are that its easier to do all queries to database since we don't need to get and set every field like with JDBC.
Another benefit is about coding, it`s easier and cleaner. 
The big differences i see is JDBC needs more code and do some stuff that hibernate solves for you, in other hand JDBC can be useful to
understand how frameworks works.
