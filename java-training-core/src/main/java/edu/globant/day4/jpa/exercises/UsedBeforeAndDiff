I never worked with JPA, before the class i think was just a specification. I prefer hibernate, because is a JPA implementation and i think is 
going better and better but i can`t said too much as i only used hibernate. I will prefer JPA standard over JDBC because in general with an ORM
you need to write less code, so you can focus in business rules and behavior instead writing a lot of code that seems to be the same all the time.
Is good to know there are another implementations, usually most people goes for most common option, in this case hibernate.
