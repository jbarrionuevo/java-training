I have never used layers and tiers in a project.
I used a 3-layer model in a college project, in Grails. The layers were: Model, View, and Controller.
In the model layer, I put all business logic.
In the view layer, I designed objects so that the user can interact with the system.
In the controller layer, I designed all interactions between Model and View.
